## How to install on your Raspberry Pi 4

- If you're familiar with flashing an SD card for the Pi, please follow whatever method you normally use. 

The instructions below use Balena Etcher:

1. Get Balena Etcher: [https://www.balena.io/etcher/](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
2. Download the [latest release mixxx-pi zip](https://github.com/fayaaz/3d-print-tools-pi-gen/releases/latest)
3. Make sure your SD card is connected to the computer
4. Open Balena Etcher
5. Select 'Flash from File' and pick the zip you downloaded earlier
6. Select the SD card to flash to (check here that you're not overwriting something important!)
7. Hit 'Flash!'
8. Once this is done and verified, remove the SD card and transfer it to your raspberry pi
9. Turn on the raspberry pi (make sure it's plugged into a screen) and wait until mixxx shows up
